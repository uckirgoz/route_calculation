# Dynamon Coding Challenge:
- The repo contains a NEXT.js boilerplate application for you to start with.
- Clone the repo and create a feature branch to work on.
- Create an SPA with a map that presents interaction to the user.
- The user should be able to click the map to add a set of route points.
- The user should be able to name their route - and enter a speed which the route will be driven at.
- The app should calculate the total route distance and the amount of time it would take to drive the route at the chosen speed.
- Submit a pull request on the repo so that we can pull your code back into the main branch when ready.
